Hi, I'm currently a [Data Scientist at Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-w-oddy/). I previously worked at the University of Oxford as a postdoctoral researcher and before that as a PhD student at Rothamsted Research. Check out [my personal website](https://josephoddy.github.io/) for some examples of my work.
